README
  This README assumes you have already completed the setup process outlined in the manual.pdf. If you encounter any issues during installation, please refer to manual.pdf again for detailed instructions and retry the installation. We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the haptic device by exploring the demos provided by 3D Systems.

Getting Started:
1.Connect and Calibrate the Haptic Touch Device: Connect the haptic device to your computer. Open “Touch Smart Setup” when the device is connected. The program should display an animated device synced with the haptic device in the center of the window. Insert the stylus into the inkwell and click “Save Configuration” at the bottom of the window.
2. Launch the Project in Unity: Open the “Test Haptic 3 Blocks”  project in Unity and check for any errors. If there are issues with the code, compilation error messages with red hazard signs will appear in the console. We recommend not modifying the code and using it as provided to ensure successful execution on the first attempt.
3. Run the Scene in Unity: Run the “Quadrotor Test” Scene in Unity by clicking the play button at the top of the window. Move the haptic device stylus around to ensure it syncs with the in-game stylus movement. Occasionally, the haptic device may disconnect, resulting in a loss of feedback. If this happens, wait a few moments and rerun the program. Ensure that the haptic device is securely plugged in.

Features of the “Test Haptic 3 Blocks”  Project:
  The project features an intuitive keyboard-based control scheme for drone movement, enabling precise navigation and adjustments. Haptic feedback enhances the experience by enabling simultaneous drone control and providing a more immersive interaction.
